## About Backcraft

<b>Backcraft now supports incremental backups!</b> if the data hasn't change, why backup it again?

Backcraft is a desktop app backup tool for Windows, designed 
to help you make backups of your Minecraft folder, which includes in-game configuration files, launcher options, worlds, screenshots, resource packs and more.

Archives are copied, compressed and labeled easily for you to restore them if there were a problem with your files, plus there is a log file where you can see what, where and when the backup was made.

## Installation and usage
